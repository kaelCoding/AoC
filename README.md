## 📖 Introduction

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent Calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skills and levels, which can be solved in any programming language.

In this project, I mainly use C++ to practice optimization thinking and data processing.

## 🛠️ How to run code (How to run)

To test my solutions on your machine:
